# Changes to Syllabus

The course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary.


# Outcomes

After successfully completing this course:

1. **Foundation.** Students will have a solid foundation in the subset of programming concepts that are most relevant to working with data. These are essential for text analysis, and they also have broad application for empirical research in general for both micro and macro students.
1. **Data management.** They will learn techniques for designing and managing data collection processes and transforming raw data into forms for use with text analysis.
1. **Text analysis models.** Students will have experience using a variety of text analysis techniques using guided examples, and they will gain familiarity with additional techniques, the problems they address, and resources for further learning.
1. **Panel regression.** Because commonly-used text data often maps on to a panel data structure, they will briefly cover both the underlying rationales and the practical procedures for using fixed effects and random effects, and also deciding which is most appropriate.
1. **Survey of top journal papers.** They will read and examine top journal papers that have successfully used text analysis to answer theoretical questions.
1. **Validation.** Because many submitted papers using these techniques fail to provide strong evidence of validity, students will examine validity, and the methods used for validation, in detail.
1. **Familiarity with process.** Overall, students will learn actionable techniques for use in each phase of executing a study using text analysis (and for empirical studies in general), from planning, to execution, to publishing.


# Assignments and expectations


## Course Requirements

The percentages below are approximate.
My baseline expectation is that every student should earn an A in a doctoral seminar.
I have selected the required work to be important for your development, and I have provided self-study resources for deeper looks at topics which may be helpful.
If your work, in either quality or completeness, falls somewhat short of my expectations, you will likely earn a B.
Below that (and you really should not be), you will hear from me.


assignment | percentage
-----------|:---------:
Exam 1 | 40
Exam 2 | 30
Outlines | 30


# Grading Policy

Final grades will conform to the following scale:

percentage | letter
-----------|:-----:
90+   | A
80–89 | B
70–79 | C
60–69 | D
0–59  | F


## Participation and attendance

This is a doctoral seminar, and I expect you to be in class and well-prepared every day, and I expect you to complete the course content each day.
The content includes both skills training and readings designed to help you execute a high-quality study and provide evidence to reviewers.
In addition, the course content is very path dependent, so it will be challenging to miss a day.

Of course, if you have some issue, let me know.


## Exams

1. **Methods.** Exam I is a practical exam that you will complete over time and submit at the time in the table above.
1. **Design.** Exam II is a comps-style exam that is likely to be a two-choose-one format. You will take this exam during the final exam period.


## Reading outlines

During the semester, we will split up the readings such that one student takes the lead for each (or most of) the papers that we cover.
However, each student should read each paper.

The student assigned to a paper will circulate an outline covering the items listed below.
Note that this should be bullet points and be curated to cover the most important topics.
At most, this should be 1.5 pages long, and can certainly be shorter for most papers.
The initial circulation should be by noon, two days before our class.
Then, the other students should make additions or edits as they see fit, with the lead student making the final edit before class.

- Theory and overall takeaways of the paper.
- Methods and software used.
- Measure validation.
- Completeness of the methods description for reproducing the study.
- Other interesting notes.
